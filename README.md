# VRoadtrip #

### Winner of the Hello World Hackathon 2017 Best Web Development Application ###

VRoadtrip takes a Google Maps driving route between two points and turns it into a timelapse of Street View imagesâ€”a virtual roadtrip.

Demo: [vroadtrip.tk](vroadtrip.tk)

## Uses ##

* Provide visual learners a way to familiarize themselves with routes beyond standard Google Maps directions
* Awesome past road trips deserve to be remembered! VRoadtrip can help bring back nostalgia and good memories by reminding users of amazing past road trips routes they went on.

## Future Improvements ##

* Allow users to add waypoints to ensure their road trip highlights make the video
* Develop a feature for users to connect their own picture albums and/or music albums to play in tandem.
